"""Self-check for the /ws/audio handler's orchestration: ready/greeting flow,
call_started validation, auth gate, and the VAD -> ASR -> Conversation ->
TTS turn end to end.

Known gap noted in BACKEND_COMPLETION.md's progress log ("main.py has no
unit tests at all today"). Follows the same fakes-over-real-models pattern as
test_asr.py/test_vad.py/test_conversation.py: app.state is populated by hand
(TestClient never enters the `with` form, so lifespan()'s real model loading
never runs - see below), and the real TenVad native model is swapped for a
scripted stub the same way test_vad.py stubs `segmenter._vad.process`,
except here the stub has to sit one level up (`backend.vad.TenVad` itself),
because the WS handler constructs its own TenVadSegmenter internally with no
injection point.

Deliberately NOT covered here: a barge-in integration test through this WS
surface. ActiveSpeech already has full, deterministic unit coverage
(test_barge_in.py); reproducing that through a real asyncio.to_thread TTS
delay and a second concurrent WS send would be timing-sensitive and flaky in
a way that would make this suite less trustworthy, not more - a known,
deliberate scope cut rather than an oversight.
